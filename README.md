# novaGF
A simple HTML page running on static server where the user can switch between 2 games: a classic 2048 and one "simplified" version of it...

## Plan
Entry point and only HTML page: "Nova GF.html".

All scripts except external references are in script folder.

All styles are in style folder.

Media folder contains images necessary to the program.

## External references
* RequireJS
* VueJS

All external references are imported via online official repositories accessed by URL. **This means that an internet connection is essential for the program to run correctly.!**
